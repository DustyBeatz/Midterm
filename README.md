# Midterm


This project is the design of an interactive application for HouseCom™'s new product, ThermoSecure™. Users can interact in a one-page mobile-first web application that pairs with their new ThermoSecure™ product. This readme will give a rundown on the running of our interactive application and the resources we used.
